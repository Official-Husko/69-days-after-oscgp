Infested Square [A10]
The Infested Square functions differently from the other Expeditions, and is still in a somewhat experimental phase.
To complete each phase of the Infested Square expedition you must send as many characters with the best weapons you can. For now, since characters can share items, the answer is to send as many characters as you have to the Square at once, each with the Rifle selected. If you don't have the Rifle, select the Pistol, if you don't have the Pistol, select the Katana.
In the final version of the game, there will be more than 5 possible weapons to choose from, and characters will not be able to select the same item at one time, so the tactics will change at that point (Additionally, certain characters will be better with certain weapons, providing more options for advantages if you have a specific Character/Weapon combo).
