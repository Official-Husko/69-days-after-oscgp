# 69 Days After OSCGP

#### 69 Days After Open Source Community Godot Port

The goal of this project is to open-source the game ***69 Days After*** in a more appropriate engine for 2D games with the ability to be modded and modified for one's needs. Sadly the official product has cheats that are locked behind a paywall. I don't believe in hiding cheats behind a paywall.

    <summary>Arrr, me hearties, this be fer me pirate brethren!</summary>

    Roses be crimson, violets be blue, In the bygone days, cheats were free, 'tis true, But now they be trapped behind a paywalled crew, Aboard our ship, we'll put an end to this rue.
    With skull flag high, we set sail with glee, Across the high seas, fierce pirates are we, No paywalls shall shackle, no more decree, In gaming's realm, we'll set the secrets free!
    So join me hearties, as we embark on this quest, To break the chains, and put paywalls to rest, With the wind at our back, we'll stand the test, Free cheats for all, till the sun sets in the west!
